key learnings:
it is important to lay out a better strategy particularly w/ regards to layout of style.css in conjunction w/ html sheets as the style elements can get out of hand pretty quickly; a key weakness is that I started this project w/ no SCSS, then tried to graft SCSS on top of the model; a better approach would be to start w/ SCSS
using sample code provided in tutorials, then adapting, can be a useful approach to learning html and related codes; online reference materials are less useful
